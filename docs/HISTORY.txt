1.4 (2012-01-06)

This version has been tested with Plone 4.0.10, Plone 4.1.3 and Plone 4.2b1.
Plone 3 is no longer supported, but should still work.


1.3 (2010-10-27)

- The view_methods attribute is no longer clobbered on install.
  [regebro]

  [regebro]


1.2 (2010-06-30)
----------------

- import Batch directly from PloneBatch since with Zope 2.13 Batch is not

- Forced reverse sorting in the view.
  [regebro]


1.1 (2010-06-05)
----------------

- collective.blog.feeds needed a setting for portal_types, so for consistency
  collective.blog.view now uses the same setting with the same default. 
  [regebro]

- It now shows the amount of comments each entry has, if it has comments
  enabled. [regebro]
  
- The view now accepts year and month parameters (in the url or form) and
  then restricts the entries to these dates. This means the view now also
  can work as an archive view. [regebro]
  
- Added credits to Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek. [regebro]

- Plone 4 support. [regebro]
  
- Make use of the typesUseViewActionInListings site property. [regebro]
